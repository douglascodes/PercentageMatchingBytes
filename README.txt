A simple x86_64 Linux assembly program for comparing the percentage of matching bytes between two files. Why do this? I need it to check the accuracy of another program I am writing in Ruby. I have a known correct answer... and I need to find how close the test subject is to the correct one. Plus, bowties are cool!
